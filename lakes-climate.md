## Changing lakes due to human activity

Anthropogenic actions, such as human activities related to agriculture, industry and urbanisation, have significantly impacted inland waters around the world. Sometimes anthropogenic actions work with climate change towards negative impacts.

One major impact of anthropogenic actions is pollution of inland water which can come from agricultural runoff, industrial discharge and urban wastewater. A way to assess water quality is to monitor parameters such as chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended solids and turbidity. Another significant impact of anthropogenic actions on inland waters is habitat destruction and alteration. Deforestation, land use changes and dam construction can alter river flow regimes, disrupt natural habitats, and affect aquatic biodiversity. 

### Map

The [turbidity of a lake](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lwq) describes water clarity, or whether sunlight can penetrate deeper parts of the lake. Turbidity often varies seasonally, both with the discharge of rivers and growth of phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria).

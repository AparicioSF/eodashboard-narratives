## Evapotranspiration and water level in the Colorado River

One of the main effects from rising temperatures is the increase in evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration is the combined process by which water moves from Earth’s surface into the atmosphere through evaporation or transpiration [1]. This can contribute directly to the decrease of waterbodies' extents and levels.

One example of this is the Colorado River, located in the southwest United States and northwest Mexico. This 2330 km-long river passes through arid regions on the west slope of the Rocky Mountains, and is a source of drinking water, irrigation and electricity for more than 40 million people and 5 million acres of farmland [2]. The Colorado River feeds the two largest reservoirs in the country — Lake Powell and Lake Mead, two national park sites that generate hydropower for millions of people [3].

Rising temperatures caused by the climate crisis have led to higher evaporation rates and reduced snowpack in the Rocky Mountains, which are the primary source of water for the Colorado River [4]. For every 1°C in temperature rise, flow along the Colorado River has dipped 9.3%, an equivalent of 1.5 billion tonnes of water [5].

The worst known megadrought in the Colorado River occurred around 1800 years ago [6]. The cause is not clear, but it is believed to have been caused by natural climate variability. However, the current drought is largely driven by anthropogenic climate change. Climate change along with its overuse of Colorado river water [7, 8], exacerbated a decrease in the river’s flow and water levels, drastically impacting the water available for agriculture, industry, as well as support for aquatic habitats [2,10].

After more than two decades of drought, researchers have documented the lowest water levels ever seen at both Powel and Mead reservoirs [3]. Seeing as the river’s resources had been overexploited, combined with the dry conditions, meant that the water was not replenishing as fast as people were using it [11]. In 2022, the Colorado River and Lake Powell were believed to be at a tipping point [9] leading to the discussions on the need for big reductions in water allocation along the river basin. On May 22 2023, three American states announced a historic deal to have a significant cut in the water usage over the next four years to prevent a crisis in the largest reservoir of the country [4].

## Changing precipitation patterns affecting Tonlé Sap Lake’s hydrology

Changing rainfall patterns due to climate change can affect water levels and the hydrology of water bodies. An example is the Tonlé Sap Lake in Cambodia - one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the world and the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia [1]. Every year during the monsoon season, the Mekong river floods and reverses the flow of the Tonlé Sap, replenishing the lake and fish stock [2]. However, changes in precipitation patterns and manmade infrastructures have led to irregular and unpredictable water flows, impacting the lake's seasonal flood patterns [1,3,4].

Water levels in Tonlé Sap hit historic lows for the third year in a row in 2021 [2]. Moreover, the construction of dams and hydropower projects in the upstream areas of the Tonlé Sap basin has altered the natural water flow and sedimentation patterns in the lake [2,4]. In addition to climate change, large-scale dams are disrupting the timing and size of floods during the wet seasons, which are critical to sustaining the health of the Tonlé Sap and the Mekong basin and maintaining the livelihoods of millions of people. In fact, this lake is also at a tipping point, as it faces the imminent risk of ecological collapse due to the combination of threats from dams and climate change [5].

In addition, recent studies have shown that water level changes in the Mekong River due to dams are likely to have dramatic effects on the Tonlé Sap water level, greatly affecting the ecosystem. Relatively small rises in the lake's water level would permanently inundate disproportionately large areas of floodplain, leaving them inaccessible to floodplain vegetation and eroding the productivity basis of the ecosystem [7]. The water changes in water discharge from the Mekong River have also been affecting the inflow of sediments, nutrients and migratory aquatic animals, which are essential to the ecosystem [8]. In fact, in 2019, a combination of climate change, El Nino, and dams on the Mekong resulted in the Tonlé Sap River flowing backwards for weeks (rather than months) leaving the lake’s water warm, shallow and oxygen-deprived, which eventually led to the a decline of 80-90% of fisheries [9].

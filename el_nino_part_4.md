# El Niño 2023-2024: floodings and cyclone impacts in East Africa

***The 2023–2024 El Niño has peaked as one of the five strongest on record. This story is the Part 4 of a series dedicated to its impacts. [Part 1](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=el-nino-extremes) focuses on record-breaking land surface temperatures, heatwaves, and nighttime temperatures, while [Part 2](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=sea-surface-temperature-rise) focuses on global sea surface temperature rises and marine heatwaves and [Part 3]() focuses on impacts on food security worldwide.***

El Niño is characterized by the warming of water surfaces in the central and eastern Pacific ocean, causing  - read more about this climate phenomenon in the first story. This warming results in a shift of the global atmospheric circulation, which can lead to extreme weather events such as [heatwaves](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=el-nino-extremes), the [global rise of sea surface temperature](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=sea-surface-temperature-rise), [droughts](), floodings and storms.


## The 2023 floodings in the 'Horn of Africa'
In the case of floodings, these happen to changes in rainfall patterns worldwide, even if they are far from the Pacific. In 2023, El Niño caused above-average rainfall, which  led to intense and prolonged downpours, causing rivers to overflow and widespread flooding. In East Africa, this rainfall is belived to amplify another ocean-atmosphere phenomenon, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)[[1]](https://www.icpac.net/fsnwg/special-report-el-ni%C3%B1o-and-positive-indian-ocean-dipole-to-have-significant-multi-sectoral-impacts-in-east-africa/), which led to widespread flooding in the Somali Region, also knonw as the **Horn of Africa**.

El Niño-induced heavy rains and flooding across East Africa in October-November 2023, claimed over 350 lives and displaced more than one million people across  Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania. In Kenya alone, 136 people lost their lives and nearly half a million were displaced. President William Ruto declared a state of emergency in response to the widespread devastation [[2]]( https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/04/africa/east-africa-floods-more-than-300-killed-intl/index.html). The flooding compounded the region’s ongoing food insecurity crisis brought on by drought conditions that have persisted since 2020 [[3]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150712/worst-drought-on-record-parches-horn-of-africa). In the ‘Horn of Africa’, there are typically two rainy seasons: the short rains from October to December and the long rains from March to May. The October-December 2023 rainy period was extreme with precipitation totals double to quadruple the average in southern and western Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. The excessive rainfall led to the Shebelle River overflowing its banks and flooding central Somalia, particularly in Beledweyne [[4]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152108/devastating-flooding-in-east-africa).

A similar event happened in western Somalia, where torrential rains caused the Juba River to overflow, inundating croplands and roads in the town of Luuq. In Baardheere, a bridge was swept away [[5]](https://www.faoswalim.org/resources/site_files/Somalia_Flood_Advisory_20_November_2023.pdf) cutting off access to the town. The University of California-Santa Barbara Climate Hazards Center [[6]](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/) uses NASA hydrological forecast and analysis system (NHyFAS [[7]](https://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/nhyfashttps://fews.net/)) products to monitor and forecast agroclimatic conditions in global famine-prone regions such as East Africa.   
In an alert issued on 8 May 2024,  the International Organization for Migration (IOM) noted torrential  rains in the preceding 5-days had caused devastating floods and mudslides that damaged infrastructure and displaced over 234,000 people, with a total of 637,000 affected. The alert covered areas of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Ethiopia and Tanzania. The toll of casualties remains unknown as of 8 of May 2024 [[8]](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/05/1149461), Aid efforts are underway in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, targeting tens of thousands affected by floods [[9]](https://wmo.int/media/news/flooding-worsens-east-africa).

In addition to heavy rains and subsequent flooding, which occurred after prolonged drought conditions in these areas, there has also been a surge in water-borne diseases such as cholera, and mosquito and flea-transmitted diseases including malaria, plague, and Rift Valley fever [[10]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/disease-vector) [[11]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/10/return-of-el-nino-raises-risk-of-hunger-drought-and-malaria-scientists-warn) , due to standing water, damaged latrines and a lack of access to safe drinking water. Furthermore, damaged infrastructure and impassable roads, particularly in the hardest-hit areas of  the region, hindered the efforts of aid agencies [[12]](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/04/africa/east-africa-floods-more-than-300-killed-intl).

#### Tropical Cyclone Freddy 
Especially due to extreme weather events (high temperature in Land and Ocean), there were many intense tropical cyclones/hurricanes and typhoons around the world. The intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy became the longest-lived named tropical cyclone on record. This exceptionally powerful, and deadly tropical cyclone that traversed the southern Indian Ocean for more than five weeks in February and March 2023.

By using GSMaP data with ALOS-2 data for inundation area estimation, JAXA monitors precipitation and inundated area by Cyclone Freddy. Freddy made its first landfall near Mananjary,  **Madagascar, on 21 February 2023**. Though it weakened while crossing the island, the cyclone regained strength once it entered the Mozambique Channel. It reached Mozambique on 24 February near Vilankulos, causing further damage.

####  Final landafall in Quelimane, Mozambique
After crossing Mozambique and returning to the channel, Freddy intensified again and made its final landfall near Quelimane on 11 March. By 14 March, the storm had dissipated inland after causing widespread damage and flooding across Madagascar, Mozambique, and surrounding regions.

## Open Science datasets
Satellites can serve an important role in monitoring floods worldwide, with sensors that measure changes in water levels, flood extent, and flood damage to crops and infrastructure.

Space agencies including ESA, NASA, and JAXA offer access to these datasets, equipping emergency responders, researchers, and policymakers with critical insights. Below are some satellite missions and satellite-based, open-access datasets dedicated to flood detection and monitoring:

### Missions
- [Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission]() captures radar imagery, allowing to detect changes in surface water levels, identify flooded areas, and assess the severity of flooding events with high spatial resolution. In fact, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) has developed the Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) system that processes all incoming Sentinel-1 data to provide near-real time flood extent maps. 

- [Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission]() can contribute to flood monitoring through its multispectral imaging capabilities at various wavelengths, enabling the detection of floodwater and the assessment of flood extent, land cover changes, and flood-induced damages, and is used also by Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS). 

- [NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites]() also play a vital role in flood monitoring. Satellites such as Landsat, Terra, Aqua, and SMAP provide microwave, multispectral,thermal imaging data, which can be used to monitor changes in water bodies, identify flooded areas, and assess flood impacts on surrounding landscapes. 

- [NASA’s SWOT](), launched in 2022, measures global river water level, slope, width, and area, which supports space-based estimates of river discharge.  

- [NASA/JAXA’s Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission]() provides valuable information on precipitation patterns and intensity, aiding in flood forecasting and early warning systems.

### Datasets
- [NASA also produces an operational, surface water extent product]() that merges NASA Landsat and ESA Sentinel-2 data. Merging observations from multiple satellites is one way to ensure that extreme hydrological events are comprehensively observed, enhancing flood detectability . 

- [JAXA's multi-satellite global precipitation map named “GSMaP]() JAXA operates the “GSMaP” map under the GPM Mission, by using Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) onboard GPM core satellites, other GPM constellation satellites, and Geostationary satellites in cooperation with partners. The main feature of the GSMaP algorithm is utilization of various attributes derived from the spaceborne precipitation radar, TRMM/PR and GPM/DPR. Precipitation information by GSMaP has been widely used, not only for scientific purposes, but also for meteorology, disaster prevention, climate monitoring, agricultural monitoring, public health, education and so on. GSMaP website offers the following global precipitation information: 
	- [JAXA REALTIME RAINFALL WATCH](https://sharaku.eorc.jaxa.jp/GSMaP_NOW/index.htm)
Shows global precipitation map, updated every 30 minutes.For users who would like to see precipitation in the past specific date.
	- [JAXA GLOBAL RAINFALL WATCH](https://sharaku.eorc.jaxa.jp/GSMaP/index.htm)

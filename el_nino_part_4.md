#  El Niño 2023-2024 (Part 4):  Severe flooding in East Africa
El Niño-induced heavy rains and flooding across East Africa in October-November 2023, claimed over 350 lives and displaced more than one million people across  Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanzania. In Kenya alone, 136 people lost their lives and nearly half a million were displaced. President William Ruto declared a state of emergency in response to the widespread devastation [[1]]( https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/04/africa/east-africa-floods-more-than-300-killed-intl/index.html). The flooding compounded the region’s ongoing food insecurity crisis brought on by drought conditions that have persisted since 2020 [[2]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150712/worst-drought-on-record-parches-horn-of-africa). In the ‘Horn of Africa’, there are typically two rainy seasons: the short rains from October to December and the long rains from March to May. The October-December 2023 rainy period was extreme with precipitation totals double to quadruple the average in southern and western Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. The excessive rainfall led to the Shebelle River overflowing its banks and flooding central Somalia, particularly in Beledweyne [[3]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152108/devastating-flooding-in-east-africa).

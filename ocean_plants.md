## Following the Activity of Phytoplankton – The Miracle Plants in The Ocean

When most of us think of plants, we envision the vibrant colors of a beautiful garden, a lush rainforest, or even a healthy bowl of salad. Plants provide us with essential nutrients, and they are critical to maintaining carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels in the atmosphere and regulating Earth’s climate.

Just as important to sustaining life on land, however, are plants in the oceans, which have been studied with advanced satellites and monitoring instruments for more than 30 years.

Before satellite sensors, we thought the open ocean was plain and lacking any significant features. For many years, we depended on measurements taken only from oceanographic ships, but these were laborious and only covered a tiny portion of the ocean at a given time. With a daily focus on the entire Earth, satellite images have revealed a view of the ocean that is as rich and complex as that of land.

About half of the oxygen we take in every breath comes from microscopic plants in the ocean called phytoplankton. Similar to land-based plants, phytoplankton are at the base of the food chain, and they release oxygen during photosynthesis – a process in which energy from the sun is used to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into carbon that is used for growth. Phytoplankton come in different shapes and sizes, and different species have different roles in the ocean ecosystem.

As with land vegetation, there are areas of the ocean where phytoplankton are in abundance and other areas where phytoplankton are scarce. One big difference, however, is that phytoplankton are much more difficult to see than a tree in a forest. Satellites give scientists the data to find and measure the amounts of phytoplankton, and to determine ocean primary productivity, which measures the mass of carbon per area of the ocean over time (mg C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>).

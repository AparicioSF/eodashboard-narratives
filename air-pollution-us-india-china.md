## Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)

**A picture diary of air quality in the northeastern regions of India, China, and the United States.**

Air quality levels in the northeastern regions of India, China, and the U.S. are monitored and recorded daily -- all from the watchful eye of one satellite and its instruments, stationed 440 miles above Earth's surface.

As it is with many areas on the globe, the air pollution levels in northeastern India, China and the U.S. have changed significantly over the past two decades, specifically for air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).

**Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)** is an air pollutant that leads to acid rain, haze, and many health-related problems. This pollutant is primarily produced through the burning of coal to generate electricity. **Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)** is a gas that is emitted into the air from the burning of fossil fuels. NO<sub>2</sub> is injected into the atmosphere in the emissions from cars, trucks, buses, and power plants.

To better understand how NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> pollution is changing around the world, scientists are using data from the northeastern regions of **India, China, and the U.S**. for several case studies. These studies monitor changes in these pollutants over time and can inform the actions that attempt to clean the air.

Air pollution is now considered the world's largest environmental health threat, accounting for an estimated seven million deaths every year, according to the World Health Organization. Monitoring the gasses that produce air pollution provide data to help identify the sources of these pollutants, and potentially lessen their health impact.

NASA scientists began monitoring and measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in 2004. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), stationed on NASA's [Aura satellite](https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html), provides a unique insight on gasses such as NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, as well as aerosols, such as smoke, dust, and sulfates.

Since its launch, OMI data has seen hazardous gas emissions drop significantly in some areas, while rising in others. Scientists are using the images and data collected to better understand the role of human activities in these changes, and which changes occur through natural processes.

## United States


For example, this image shows decreases in SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> in the Ohio River Valley region of the United States. (Note: this website features an interactive tool that allows you to draw a box around areas of interest and see timeseries data for that region). The decreases in the U.S. can be attributed in large part to improved emissions from cars and trucks, as well as a reduction in the sulfur content in fuel. Some improvement is also the result of technology that does a better job of trapping nitrogen and sulfur oxides from power plant smokestacks. Â

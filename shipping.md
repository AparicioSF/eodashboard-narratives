## Shipping Activity at Major Ports

Supply chains around the world dependent on cargo shipping have been interrupted by travel restrictions and quarantines designed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Many ports are closed, shipments have been canceled, and, in some locations, altered shipping routes have prevented the efficient movement of cargo.

NASA and ESA researchers are using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology and high-resolution satellite imagery from [Planet Labs](https://www.planet.com/) and [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) to track shipping activity at major ports in the U.S. and in Europe during the coronavirus pandemic.

This data will help quantify the level of shipping-related economic activity over time and could eventually contribute to our understanding of the environmental implications of global decreases in shipping on key air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).

#   The Biomass Harmonization Activity

Trees and other plants pull vast amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere every year, incorporating some of that carbon into their organic structure, what Earth scientists call plant biomass. Measuring and monitoring the size and changes in this biomass carbon is an important part of the Paris Agreement on climate change. If a forest is cut down, for example, the carbon stored in those trees will count towards that country’s annual carbon emissions.

As part of the Paris Agreement, the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) will take stock of the best available information on aboveground biomass carbon in 2023, as part of their “Global Stocktake.” The Global Stocktake will set benchmarks for how much biomass carbon exists on land. The UNFCCC will use these benchmarks to track countries’ progress toward meeting [Paris Agreement targets.](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement)

# Crops Consume Cairo’s Carbon Dioxide
## Story of Cairo

Cairo, the capital city of Egypt, is home to more than 20 million people, making it the most populated city in Africa. The city is located on the fertile floodplain of the Nile River and is surrounded by farmland, with a high concentration of farmland to the north. The farmland stands out in satellite imagery against the drier deserts of Egypt, and during the growing season crops absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be measured from space.

The following maps show examples of the changes of atmospheric CO2 concentrations based on the growth and photosynthetic activity of crops on nearby farms.

We can observe the emission of CO2 from cars, power plants, and other fossil-fuel burning activities from space using the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Greenhouse gasses Observing Satellite (GOSAT). We can also observe how crops on surrounding farmlands consume CO2 by looking at solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). SIF is an innovative measurement that serves as a proxy of plant photosynthetic activity. Crops and other plants absorb white light from the sun and when photosynthesis occurs, they emit some of the unused energy from the sun as a red glow, known as SIF.

By combining GOSAT data, TROPOMI SIF data, surface wind data, and a statistical megacity emission inventory, we can monitor daily atmospheric changes of CO2. GOSAT observes tropospheric partial column density of carbon dioxide (CO2) over global megacities and provides the CO2 enhancement from lower atmosphere (0-4 km) density minus upper atmosphere (4-12 km) density.

In this research, researchers from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency demonstrate how CO2 levels over Cairo change over time based on trends in combustion, SIF levels, and wind direction.

Egypt has two growing seasons, one in the summer and one in the winter. In the summer, the map below shows there were low CO2 levels over Cairo, correlated with high SIF.

Use the **interactive maps** on the next page to see the variations of NO<sub>2</sub>, SIF and XCO<sub>2</sub> levels over Cairo. The compare feature on the map allows looking at the levels two different dates. The following products can be explored:

**GOSAT lower tropospheric CO2 enhancement** in daily [ppm] GOSAT tropospheric partial column observes global changes of the carbon dioxide (CO2) enhancement; the CO2 density difference between lower atmosphere (0-4 km) influenced by CO2 net flux, i.e., surface emission and uptake, minus upper atmosphere (4-12 km) as background. The report on GOSAT partial column density products was submitted to UNFCCC for the first global stocktake as space-based surface GHG Emission Indicator (GEI) over the city.

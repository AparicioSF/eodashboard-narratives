## Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier

Pine Island Glacier and neighboring Thwaites Glacier are two of the main pathways for ice from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet entering the Amundsen Sea. Because of their remote location and often hazardous terrain, only a few researchers have ever made the trip to study these glaciers close-up. The glaciers have an immense impact on the rest of the planet and are closely monitored for their potentially harmful effects on sea levels. Thwaites, one of the fastest-retreating glaciers in Antarctica, is nicknamed the “[Doomsday Glacier](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/05/world/thwaites-doomsday-glacier-sea-level-climate/index.html)”. According to a 2020 estimate from the [International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration](https://thwaitesglacier.org/), four percent of sea level rise directly related to climate change came from Thwaites alone, and a sudden total collapse would raise global sea levels 25 inches more. Collectively, the region contains enough vulnerable ice to raise global sea level by about 1.2 meters (four feet).

Scientists have undertaken a multi-part international project (<https://thwaitesglacier.org/>) to study the vast glacier from all angles. The urgency stems from observations and analyses showing that the amount of ice flowing from Thwaites contributing to sea level rise has doubled in the span of three decades. 

## Explore Landsat Observations of the Thwaites Glacier

On the map, you can browse over 20 years of cloud-free level-2 surface reflectance Landsat data (2001-2023) acquired over the Thwaites glacier.

The following image pair demonstrates the changes that have occurred since the start of this century. The first image, acquired with the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on Landsat 7, shows the glacier’s floating ice tongue on December 2, 2001 shortly before it calved Iceberg B-22. The second image, acquired with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8, shows the glacier on December 28, 2019.

Owing to climate change, ice all over the world is melting. Antarctica, Greenland and the Arctic are all experiencing some of the fastest melting in recorded history. The Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is one of the most important glaciers on Earth, not only owing to its size, but because of the massive amounts of ice that will melt due to global warming – threatening coastal communities around the world. Thwaites, also known as the ‘Doomsday Glacier,’ is located in West Antarctica and, according to a 2020 estimate from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, is currently responsible for four percent of total global sea level rise. Thwaites acts as a ‘pin’ that holds back the rest of the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. If it were to collapse, it could trigger a runway collapse of the entire ice sheet, raising global sea levels by around 60 cm. Understanding the dynamics of Thwaites Glacier and the potential risks it poses to sea level rise is crucial for formulating effective strategies to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

## Melting of Thwaites Glacier could affect sea levels for years to come

Ice loss from the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica ends up in the Amundsen Sea primarily through two mechanisms: melting and calving.



- Melting occurs when warm ocean water comes into contact with the glacier's ice shelf, which is the floating extension of the glacier that extends out into the ocean. As the ocean water melts the ice shelf, the glacier's grounding line (the point where the glacier begins to float) retreats inland, allowing more ice to be exposed to the ocean and more ice to be lost through melting.

- Calving, on the other hand, is the process by which large chunks of ice break off the ice shelf and fall into the ocean. This can happen when the ice shelf becomes too thick and heavy, or when meltwater pools on the surface of the ice shelf and causes the ice to fracture. When calving occurs, the ice shelf loses mass and the glacier retreats.

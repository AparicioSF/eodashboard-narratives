Owing to climate change, ice all over the world is melting. Antarctica, Greenland and the Arctic are all experiencing some of the fastest melting in recorded history. The Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is one of the most important glaciers on Earth, not only owing to its size, but because of the massive amounts of ice that will melt due to global warming – threatening coastal communities around the world. Thwaites, also known as the ‘Doomsday Glacier,’ is located in West Antarctica and, according to a 2020 estimate from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, is currently responsible for four percent of total global sea level rise. Thwaites acts as a ‘pin’ that holds back the rest of the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. If it were to collapse, it could trigger a runway collapse of the entire ice sheet, raising global sea levels by around 60 cm. Understanding the dynamics of Thwaites Glacier and the potential risks it poses to sea level rise is crucial for formulating effective strategies to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

## Melting of Thwaites Glacier could affect sea levels for years to come

Ice loss from the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica ends up in the Amundsen Sea primarily through two mechanisms: melting and calving.



- Melting occurs when warm ocean water comes into contact with the glacier's ice shelf, which is the floating extension of the glacier that extends out into the ocean. As the ocean water melts the ice shelf, the glacier's grounding line (the point where the glacier begins to float) retreats inland, allowing more ice to be exposed to the ocean and more ice to be lost through melting.

- Calving, on the other hand, is the process by which large chunks of ice break off the ice shelf and fall into the ocean. This can happen when the ice shelf becomes too thick and heavy, or when meltwater pools on the surface of the ice shelf and causes the ice to fracture. When calving occurs, the ice shelf loses mass and the glacier retreats.

## How can satellites help monitor the Thwaites Glacier?

Satellites are a powerful tool used to study the Thwaites Glacier as they provide a long-term view of the ice that is difficult to obtain through ground-based measurements. One of the primary ways satellites are used to measure ice is through the use of radar instruments, such as Copernicus Sentinel-1. This allows scientists to monitor the Thwaites Glacier and other ice sheets and glaciers in Antarctica more frequently and with greater detail than would be possible otherwise.

These instruments can penetrate through the surface of the ice and measure the ice's surface elevation. By comparing elevation measurements over time, scientists can determine whether the ice sheet or glacier is growing or shrinking. Satellites also provide essential information about ice dynamics such as ice velocity, which allows scientists to track ice movement and get information about how fast the ice is moving and calving.

In a recent study, scientists have developed new Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques using radar images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite mission, to reveal how the Thwaites Glacier Ice Tongue is being damaged by squeezing and stretching as it flows from the middle of the continent to the coast.

The research focused on a part of the glacier system where the ice flows into the sea and begins to float – the grounding line. It forms the start of the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf and the western Thwaites Glacier Ice Tongue, which is also an ice shelf. Sentinel-1’s all-weather radar allows scientists to track ice movement and peer through snow cover to unveil Thwaites Glacier Tongue’s crocodile skin-like appearance, which is normally hidden from sight. Interactive Sentinel-1 data displayed on a map over Thwaites Glacier, users can browse through the datasets on various dates.

Using machine learning, the researchers taught a computer to look at radar images from the Sentinel-1 mission and identify changes over the last decade. The analysis revealed that over the last six years, the Thwaites Glacier Ice Tongue has sped up and slowed down twice, by around 40% each time – from 4 km a year to 6 km a year before slowing. This is a substantial increase in the magnitude and frequency of speed change compared with past records. This new use of artificial intelligence will allow scientists to more accurately monitor and model changes to this important glacier.

### Explore the Sentinel-1 Observations of the Thwaites Glacier

On the map, you can browse the Sentinel-1 images acquired in [EW (extra wide swath) mode](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/acquisition-modes/extra-wide-swath) over the Thwaites glacier from 2017 to 2021. The EW mode acquires data over a 400 km swath at 20 m by 40 m spatial resolution. The EW mode is aimed primarily for use over sea-ice, polar zones and certain maritime areas, in particular for ice, oil spill monitoring and security services.

# Monitoring from Space how Air Pollution affects Climate Change

Australia’s bushfires in the 2019-2020 season emitted about 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Using satellite data, a new study published in Nature proves how satellite measurements can illuminate the complicated ways in which Earth is responding to climate change in an era of worsening wildfires.

Australia is no stranger to bushfires, however, the 2019-2020 season proved to be unprecedented. As of March 2020, the fires burned an estimated 18.6 million hectares (or 186 000 sq km) destroying over 5000 buildings and killing over 400 people. It was estimated that more than a billion animals perished from the bushfires, with several endangered species facing the risk of total extinction.

Based on a new paper, published in _Nature_, the extreme bushfires across southeast Australia released about 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air – more than double the emissions provided by fire emission inventory datasets.

In southeast Australia, the fires were both intense and extensive. As much as 74 000 sq km of mostly eucalyptus forest, roughly 2.5 times the area of Belgium, was affected. Previous estimates from global inventory datasets of wildfire emissions based on satellite fire data and modelled quantities of standing biomass suggested that the fires released on average 275 million tonnes of carbon dioxide between November 2019 and January 2020.

However, the new analysis indicates that this figure was a gross underestimate. Using measurements from the Tropomi instrument on board the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite more accurate estimates of the emissions were obtained.

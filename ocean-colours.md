## Satellite Sensors Tracking Ocean Color Changes to Predict Phytoplankton Health

Understanding climate change effects in the marine environment – including water temperature and ocean currents – is vital to managing the sustainable use of these resources.

These changes are reflected in microscopic plant- and animal-based organisms known as phytoplankton and zooplankton, respectively, as well as in invertebrate larvae and fish throughout the food chain.

For example, the northwest Pacific Oyashio front region (Figure 1.) is considered one of the world’s highest productivity waters. In spring (April-May), the phytoplankton bloom comes later in colder years, and earlier in warmer years. The relationship between the bloom period and the growth period of predators may have an impact on higher-level ecosystems which are also used as marine resources.

Satellite sensors that observe ocean color help us estimate the spatial distribution and temporal changes in phytoplankton mass, their productivity and ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), and related environmental variables that impact ecosystem health. Satellites provide important information to adequately carry out ecosystem-based management for the sustainable use of marine biological resources.
